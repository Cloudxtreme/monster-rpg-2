Goblin: There they are! \\ Let's get 'em!\n
Goblin: Yarp!\nGoblin: ...\nGoblin: One of the trolls went on a rampage!\nGoblin: Let's just say I owe you one!\n
Locked...\n
Goblin: Hey! Get outta here!\n
Ohh, my head. This is bad! I've got to save Tiggy from that evil staff, and I'll probably need all the help I can get to do so!\nFirst things first, how do I get out of here?\n
Eny: I need to stand back and lift these boards...\n
* squeek *\n
Hm, these boards look loose...\n
Prisoner: Bless your souls! Thanks for saving me!\n
Shoot up
some baddies?
Take a look
around?
Eny: The view from here is breathtaking!\n
Troll: Neeeeeeuuu!\nEny: What are you saying?\nTroll: Naaaaaaaaaarrr!\n
Goblin 1: Say, it's the girl who escaped!\nGoblin 2: Yaa, and she's brought some friends!\n
Nanner: See what the Rider did to me?!...\nNanner: All I have left is this key, so no, you can't have it!\n
Nanner: Hmm.. and I'm going to destroy you too!\n
Rider: I underestimated you and I shouldn't have... I saw how you fight so I should have known.\nRider: You remember me? Haha...\nEny: That staff is destroying everything! You are summoning monsters into a peaceful world!\nRider: That is my destiny...\nEny: You have the power to change your destiny! Destroy the staff!\nRider: It's a part of me now, that cannot change...\nRider: It almost saddens me that I have to do this, but...\n
Goblin: Since you helped me I'm going to tell you a secret...\nMinions don't like their master, but they normally don't like you much either!\n
Rider: You must be the friend of the wizard!\nEny: You mean Tiggy? How did you know that? Where is he? Is he Ok?\nRider: Your friend just burnt Seaside to the ground.\nRider: Then he and his gang of bandits took a boat and set sail...\nRider: You wouldn't happen to know where they went?\nEny: No... I mean, maybe to the eastern Kingdom.\nRider: Ok, then I'm off...\nEny: Are you going to save him?\nRider: Uhh... Yes...\n
Eny: Wait! I'll go with you!\nRider: * sigh *\nRider: Well, you seem like a strong fighter. I may need your help.\nEny: Ok, then let's get out of here!\n
Boy am I glad you're here. A messenger said you were coming. The enemy keeps pounding us from the water.\nWe need to split up in groups of 1 to 4 and attack the enemies strategically.\nPosition your weaker members in the back and stronger ones in the front.\n
Rios: Well, I guess I have to honor my promise... to go back to Flowey and recreate the history of Seaside...\nEny: Take good care, perhaps we will see you again!\nRios: I think that is highly likely!\nEny: Goodbye...\n
I've never been part of such a big battle... it was kind of fun!\n
I want to go home and get some sleep!\n
I think we can all agree, we saved your skins out here...\n
Well, the hard work is done now...\n
Hey, never knew that 'magic' stuff would come in handy.\n
So I guess you'll bring word of this to the King?\n
WAM! BAM! I was ON FIRE!!!\n
You didn't underestimate the power of the Flowey Guard did you? Hehehehahaha!\n
Soldier: This armor is just for show. We live in peaceful times.\n
Soldier: We heard about the monsters up north! I can't believe it...\n
Soldier: In times of peace, the King allows visitors.\n
Soldier: The King is expecting you.\n
Soldier: The Throne Room is upstairs.\n
Soldier: Stop by the kitchen if you're hungry!\n
You already have some fruit...\n
You can't hold anything else...\n
You got some fruit!\n
Chef: Here you go!\n
Soldier: Have something from the kitchen!\n
Soldier: We're on break right now...\n
Soldier: I've never faced anything in battle before!\n
Soldier: It's peaceful but we still train hard!\n
Soldier: We need to step up training a notch!...\n
Chef: Finish the juice you have first, then I'll make you some more...\n
Chef: Let me make some fruit juice for you!\n
Chef: I will prepare whatever you want, but you must bring me the supplies.\n
Gunnar: What am I doing? I design machines for the King.\nEny: We hear there are monsters attacking Flowey. Do you know if it's true?\nGunnar: I've heard the rumors, but I didn't think there was any way!\nEny: Monsters have already burned down Seaside, they have been awakened.\nEny: My friend became possessed by a staff with evil powers.\nGunnar: Then I must get to Flowey, and protect my place of birth!\nEny: Join us, then!\nGunnar: The path is through the mountains!\n
Gunnar: I may have a solution...\nEny: Oh? What?\nGunnar: I have invented a steam powered underwater vehicle that is fast and packs more firepower than the largest traditional vessel.\nEny: Well, it sounds like the only hope we have...\nGunnar: Absolutely... I will prepare the craft then, and meet you at the docks when you are ready!\nEny: Thank you Gunnar, you have gone far beyond the call of duty.\n
Eny: We humbly request your help Sire. Flowey is under attack.\nEny: The people are holding the city but they can't hold it alone!\nKing: Hmm... I have heard the rumors, but how is one to believe?\nKing: If you could prove to me that there are monsters walking the earth once again, I would gladly send troops...\n
King: Please, take your rest in the castle... stay as long as you like...\n
Faelon: My Father, surely you don't believe these claims? Monsters walking the earth? It has been many years since!\nKing: Well... umm... I suppose you are right, son. I have left the troops under your control, so I trust your judgement.\nFaelon: Thank you Father. Please, my Father must rest, be on your way...\n
Eny: We have returned from Flowey with confirmation of the enemy invasion...\nKing: Save your breath child, we now know of the crisis to the north.\nKing: We deeply regret not sending troops to battle the monsters... but we hear you have quelled the immediate danger.\nEny: Yes, but we fear it will not stop until we uproot the evil that is in the staff my good friend holds.\nKing: Well, you may be in luck. A fisherman was here not an hour ago telling of a floating fortress in the waters up north.\nEny: But the seas are swarming with threats, we should be so lucky as him to escape them safely!...\n
Eny: Well, for now we are short-handed...\nFaelon: I would be honored to serve my King by helping you!\nEny: That's great!\nFaelon: We should prepare supplies and weapons, and then leave immediately.\nFaelon: The shop may have something new you can use.\nEny: Yes, let us go...\n
King: Welcome back. My Son, it's good to see you and your friends again...\nFaelon: Father, we have nearly achieved victory, but the staff must be destroyed!\nKing: Ahh... well, there is one way...\nEny: Tell us, we'll do anything!\nKing: Throw the staff into a volcano, it's the only way.\nMel: There is a live volcano East of here, through the jungle.\nKing: Aye, that is where you must go.\nKing: And you need to go soon... Our troops are battling monsters all over the continent.\nKing: You brave four must leave soon.\nEny: Thank you Sire, we will be on our way.\nKing: Do return! \\ Faelon: Yes my Father!\n
King: Congratulations!\n
King: A staff on the moon is certainly better than a staff on the Earth...\nHowever, no place is safe as long as the staff remains.\n
King: Quick, to the volcano!\n
King: Please, take your rest in the castle... stay as long as you like...\n
Faelon: I'm glad you made it back! The turmoil is mostly over with here, thanks to you!\n
You can't go in there...\n
Shopkeeper: Welcome! We have just got some new stock!\n
Faelon: Please, give me some privacy...\n
Astronomer: Where will this planet take us next, hoohoo!\n
Astronomer: Oh dear, the volcano is being active... but I see the moon is a little bit brighter too...\n
Astronomer: Ohhh... you must be part of the disturbance in the stars!\nAstronomer: Yes, the moons are lining up and new stars are appearing all the time...\nAstronomer: I see a mountain, and a floating fortress... but that is not the end, oh no! Hehehe...\n
Eny: I could sleep here...\n
I'm from Flowey but I'm not much of a mystic...\n
Congratulations on defending Flowey!\n
That's a nice badge! It's a badge of the old Flowey guard... my grandfather was one of them!\nWant to trade?\n
Eny: We made it!...\n
Eny: Look everyone!...\n
Eny: We've done it! The staff is destroyed!\nLet's get back home now.\n
Eny: Look everyone! It's the Portal!\nTode: Noone shall pass.\nEny: In your dreams!\n
Captain: We'll be here for you mate, if you need our services again.\n
Gunnar: So, what do you think?\nRider: Is that thing seaworthy?!\nGunnar: Absolutely...\nEny: Well if it can get us to the floating fortress it will have done it's job.\nFaelon: Gunnar, are you equipped for battle?\nGunnar: No, I will have to stay with the sub, or there's no getting off of that fortress...\nFaelon: Hmm, then we need some one else...\n
Mel: I hear you're looking for help...\nRider: What help could you be?\nMel: I happen to be very skilled with magic!\nEny: You're a young girl, shouldn't you be home with your parents?\nMel: I don't have parents... I have no family at all...\nEny: Oh my... What happened?\nMel: Monsters got them...\nEny: So you think you have a score to settle then?\nMel: Yes. \\ Eny: Alright then, you can come.\nEny: Let's go straight away, we have no time to lose!\nGunnar: All aboard!\n
Captain: You want to board the ship? Aye, we set sail as soon as you're ready!\n
Captain: Alright then, off we go!\n
Mate: G'day! ...\n
Girl: There are monsters attacking people in the area near Flowey.\nGirl: The King will not believe that monsters have risen again!\nGirl: The people of Flowey cannot hold the city much longer!\n
Girl: Sure Flowey is safer now... but how long will it last?\n
Gunnar: Wow! What a feat of engineering!\n
Gunnar: No, I've never built a space craft... but I know someone who has.\nGunnar: Odd thing is he's a simple farmer!\n
Would you like to go through
the trench again, or take the
longer, safer route?

It's great to be home! The monsters only ate 1 of my babies... cows that is.\n
Guard: Am I ever glad to see you! There are two Golems breaking through the walls at the north of the village!\nGuard: Most of our troops are defending the beach front.\nEny: What can we do?\nGuard: Defeat the Golems, without walls the village will fall! And better make it quick!\n
Guard: Don't go! Take care of the Golems first!\n
Guard: No time for that! The golems are breaking through our walls!\n
Guard: Whoa! You guys are amazing!\n
Guard: Some folks have returned to their home, but most are still afraid...\n
Guard: Some of the people in the surrounding area have moved into the inn. It's dangerous out there!\n
Guard: You're my hero!\n
Guard: We'll get these walls fixed right away!\n
Guard: The new walls should hold, as long as no more golems come by...\n
Guard: We'll get these walls fixed right away!\n
Guard: Whew, I'm beat from fixing these walls.\n
Guard: Better hurry!\n
Eny: We better not take that... the guards need it.\n
Zzz...\n

Eny: Tig!! Please slow down!\nTiggy: I want to get home and cook some of those mushrooms!\n
Eny: Tiggy!! Come back!\n
Eny: Wow... what is it?\nTiggy: Some kind of wizard's staff... do you think?\nEny: No, it couldn't be...\n
Eny: Tig... what are you doing?...\nEny: Tiggy?...\n
Tiggy: Hey... what's that over there?\nEny: Come on, we have to get home before dark!\nTiggy: Just one minute, I want to see what it is...\n
Tiggy: Take her to Ohleo Keep, to the north of here.\nTiggy: ... and prepare for war!\n
Goblins: Yes, Master!\n
Rider: This is my horse. He's old so he can't carry us both.\nRider: Get going!\n
You drown in the cold sea...\n
Eny: Tiggy! I'm so glad you're alright!\nTig: Do I know you?\nEny: Tig, it's me, your friend Eny...\nTig: You don't look like a friend of mine.\nFaelon: Enough of this talk, he is the root of our problems...\nRider: He must be defeated!\nEny: No! Don't hurt him!\nTig: Hurt me?! Ahahaha... you must be playing.\n
Tig: You see... You are no match for me!\nEny: Please Tiggy, listen to me...\n
Tig: You're wasting my time!\n
Tiggy: So where do we go from here?\nEny: The abandoned Keep north of Seaside... \\ They're building an army!\nMel: Let's go, we don't have time to waste!\nEny: Hey, where's the staff...\nEny: THE STAFF!!! \\ And where is Rider?\nTiggy: I saw him leave with the staff, I thought you knew?\nEny: Oh no, we have to find him! I think he will be at the Keep.\nTiggy: Then let's go!\n
Tiggy: Eny? Who are these people? Where are we?...\nEny: Tiggy! That staff, it possessed you! You weren't yourself...\nFaelon: He darned near killed us all!\nEny: Faelon, it wasn't his fault! It's the staff...\nTiggy: I'm very sorry, I was not in control of myself.\n

Hey, I gave you my key, what more do you want?\n
Thank you so much!\n
I hope the monsters go away soon... there is nothing to do but pace in here!\n
I could get used to these beds...\nBy the way, you're heading to the beach right? Better have a good strategy... and experience in battle!\n
Farmer: After this all boils over, stop by my farm!\n
I used to be a warrior when I was young, but I can't fight anymore...\nI am blessed with a son, who may continue with my legacy.\n

Your friend finished his work here...\n
My father is helping your friend downstairs... He has so much knowledge, oh my!\n
One day I will manage this library just as my father has for so many years...\n
Rios: I've come from Seaside where the library has been destroyed. I'm here to rewrite our history.\nLibrarian: Oh what a tragic event! Please, stay and commence with your work.\nRios: I will come back, first I must help deal with the invaders on the beach.\nLibrarian: Be safe my friend, I will see you soon.\n
Welcome back!\n
I'm making copies of everything so there is one for here and one for Seaside...\n
Rios: The Staff seeks a soul to bind to...\nIt knows it is in danger here.\nDid you know that we once had communication with moon-folk?\n
Rios: This may take a while, but it has to be done.\nRios: Be very careful in your quest!\n
Take care and come back soon!\n
Rios: The entire library... destroyed.\n
Rios: Well I do have all the books memorized...\nRios: I just need a safe place to store the new collection.\nEny: We're soon heading to the Eastern Kingdom. The Kingdom MUST be safe...\nRios: I see... and could you do with the services of a Cleric?\nRider: I hope you know how to wield that staff in battle!\nRios: Sure, but healing is my specialty.\nEny: Then join us!\n
Speed is important to start, but everyone gets a turn...\n
There are 3 elements of magic...\nFire, Ice, and Electricy...\nFire burns things that are flammable. Ice freezes hot things. Electricy blasts water elementals... usually.\n
Some of the nicest treasures are the easiest to overlook...\n
If someone wants something you have, do not hesitate to trade with him...\n
Talk to everyone and you will gain much knowledge...\n
It's not how much you make, but how you spend it...\n
It is important to know your enemy's weaknesses...\n
Use formations to your advantage...\nOh, you don't know about formations?\nIf you are closer to the enemy, you do more damage...\n...but if you are farther away, you take less of a hit.\n
Take a rest and record your progress whenever you can...\n
Train wisely and balance your skills... a lopsided warrior is easy to knock down...\n
Eny: Well there it goes! We'll have to wait and see if it gets there or not...\nEny: Now, let's find that Portal on the Dark Side!\n
Witch: I knew you would come by this way... Your friend told me so.\nEny: Tiggy?! Where is he?\nWitch: Nevermind that, I'm his new best friend...\nWitch: Now you have to go back down the mountain... The hard way!\n
Shopkeeper: Everything is on sale for you my friend.\n
Female: Good luck.\n
Female: Nice looking scope...\nFemale: I'm really going to be on the losing end of this deal but...\nFemale: Here, I'll trade you for this Light Orb.\nFemale: The orb will light your path even in darkness.\n
Female: How did you get here?\n
Albert: Hello friends.\nEny: Hello. We have come in search of a staff that landed here a few days ago.\nAlbert: I have the Staff you speak of.\nEny: We must have it. It must be destroyed. It has evil powers.\nAlbert: Indeed. But the Staff's power is only present on your planet.\nEny: We need to destroy the staff. Do you know how we could do that?\nAlbert: You would have to fly it into the nearest Star, but we have no ships in this day and age.\nEny: We have a craft, but it is our only transport home...\nAlbert: Well, there is one other way...\nEny: What is it?\nAlbert: There is a Portal to your planet on the Dark Side... But it is very dangerous!\nEny: We no longer fear danger. We will brave the Dark Side after we send the staff towards the Sun.\nAlbert: Very well. You may have the Staff. It's in that chest by the window.\n
Albert: You are truly heroes!\n
Albert: We all wish you the best!\n
King Albert is very wise.\n
King Albert is a descendant of the maker of the staff.\n
We all wish to be as kind and knowledgeable as King Albert!\n
Thank you for visiting our King...\n
I was so happy when the Staff returned!\n
King Albert's ancestor traded the Staff for building materials long ago...\n
Tiggy: Oh my... I... uh... I did this?\nEny: No, this staff did this, it only used you as a vessel!\nTiggy: We must destroy this staff... perhaps the wise King would know how?\nFaelon: Indeed, let's head to the East.\n
When the fires started everyone went south.\n
Say, is that a letter?\nThat looks like my father's writing!\n... it's written to me!\nSay, if you're going east, you may need this badge...\nFair trade? O.K.\n
Captain: You want to board the ship? Aye, we set sail as soon as you're ready!\n

They created a statue of Eny to honor her!\nEny: Wow... it's such an honor!\n
Shopkeeper: Luckily for me, when the fires started, I had a rain spell!\n

Male: Hi, how are you?\n
Tipper: Oh yeah, I saw that meteor or whatever it was... landed North of here.\nTipper: I bet the King's men tracked it down.\nTipper: ... Sure I'll show you the way. I'm always up for adventure!\n
Female: Oh, Earthlings, how wonderful!\n
Male: We don't get many of your type around here these days...\n
Shopkeep: I just finished making some spicy meatballs...\nShopkeep: Warning, vegetarians may not be able to keep the meatballs down!\n
Female: Ages ago a meteor landed where this village now stands...\nFemale: Something in its makeup has kept evil away to this day.\n
Male: If one wants a wife, he must brave the dark side... Alas, I am too cowardly.\n
Female: My husband is a very adventurous fellow... he loves it but it worries me.\n
