--This seems to happen in a few other places where it's possible to  
walk past the point that's supposed to trigger a location transition.   
It's possible to get inside the castle doors from the outside but not  
go to the interior

--went to castle level, went up in castle to 2nd floor.  Went down the  
exit opposite the one I came up.  Transition effect started and went  
to a red square centered on the page and stayed there.  Left the app  
running.  eventually, it returned to the SpringBoard.  This was after  
going to a number of the other levels, so it does look like a low  
memory issue (aka a leak).  I was able to use the righthand stairs  
other times.
