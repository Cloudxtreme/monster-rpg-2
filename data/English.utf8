Goblin: There they are! \ Let's get 'em!^
Goblin: Yarp!^Goblin: ...^Goblin: One of the trolls went on a rampage!^Goblin: Let's just say I owe you one!^
Locked...^
Goblin: Hey! Get outta here!^
Ohh, my head. This is bad! I've got to save Tiggy from that evil staff, and I'll probably need all the help I can get to do so!^First things first, how do I get out of here?^
Eny: I need to stand back and lift these boards...^
* squeek *^
Hm, these boards look loose...^
Prisoner: Bless your souls! Thanks for saving me!^
Shoot up
some baddies?
Take a look
around?
Eny: The view from here is breathtaking!^
Troll: Neeeeeeuuu!^Eny: What are you saying?^Troll: Naaaaaaaaaarrr!^
Goblin 1: Say, it's the girl who escaped!^Goblin 2: Yaa, and she's brought some friends!^
Nanner: See what the Rider did to me?!...^Nanner: All I have left is this key, so no, you can't have it!^
Nanner: Hmm.. and I'm going to destroy you too!^
Rider: I underestimated you and I shouldn't have... I saw how you fight so I should have known.^Rider: You remember me? Haha...^Eny: That staff is destroying everything! You are summoning monsters into a peaceful world!^Rider: That is my destiny...^Eny: You have the power to change your destiny! Destroy the staff!^Rider: It's a part of me now, that cannot change...^Rider: It almost saddens me that I have to do this, but...^
Goblin: Since you helped me I'm going to tell you a secret...^Minions don't like their master, but they normally don't like you much either!^
Rider: You must be the friend of the wizard!^Eny: You mean Tiggy? How did you know that? Where is he? Is he Ok?^Rider: Your friend just burnt Seaside to the ground.^Rider: Then he and his gang of bandits took a boat and set sail...^Rider: You wouldn't happen to know where they went?^Eny: No... I mean, maybe to the eastern Kingdom.^Rider: Ok, then I'm off...^Eny: Are you going to save him?^Rider: Uhh... Yes...^
Eny: Wait! I'll go with you!^Rider: * sigh *^Rider: Well, you seem like a strong fighter. I may need your help.^Eny: Ok, then let's get out of here!^
Boy am I glad you're here. A messenger said you were coming. The enemy keeps pounding us from the water.^We need to split up in groups of 1 to 4 and attack the enemies strategically.^Position your weaker members in the back and stronger ones in the front.^
Rios: Well, I guess I have to honor my promise... to go back to Flowey and recreate the history of Seaside...^Eny: Take good care, perhaps we will see you again!^Rios: I think that is highly likely!^Eny: Goodbye...^
I've never been part of such a big battle... it was kind of fun!^
I want to go home and get some sleep!^
I think we can all agree, we saved your skins out here...^
Well, the hard work is done now...^
Hey, never knew that 'magic' stuff would come in handy.^
So I guess you'll bring word of this to the King?^
WAM! BAM! I was ON FIRE!!!^
You didn't underestimate the power of the Flowey Guard did you? Hehehehahaha!^
Soldier: This armor is just for show. We live in peaceful times.^
Soldier: We heard about the monsters up north! I can't believe it...^
Soldier: In times of peace, the King allows visitors.^
Soldier: The King is expecting you.^
Soldier: The Throne Room is upstairs.^
Soldier: Stop by the kitchen if you're hungry!^
You already have some fruit...^
You can't hold anything else...^
You got some fruit!^
Chef: Here you go!^
Soldier: Have something from the kitchen!^
Soldier: We're on break right now...^
Soldier: I've never faced anything in battle before!^
Soldier: It's peaceful but we still train hard!^
Soldier: We need to step up training a notch!...^
Chef: Finish the juice you have first, then I'll make you some more...^
Chef: Let me make some fruit juice for you!^
Chef: I will prepare whatever you want, but you must bring me the supplies.^
Gunnar: What am I doing? I design machines for the King.^Eny: We hear there are monsters attacking Flowey. Do you know if it's true?^Gunnar: I've heard the rumors, but I didn't think there was any way!^Eny: Monsters have already burned down Seaside, they have been awakened.^Eny: My friend became possessed by a staff with evil powers.^Gunnar: Then I must get to Flowey, and protect my place of birth!^Eny: Join us, then!^Gunnar: The path is through the mountains!^
Gunnar: I may have a solution...^Eny: Oh? What?^Gunnar: I have invented an underwater vehicle that is fast and packs more firepower than the largest traditional vessel.^Eny: Well, it sounds like the only hope we have...^Gunnar: Absolutely... I will prepare the craft then, and meet you at the docks when you are ready!^Eny: Thank you Gunnar, you have gone far beyond the call of duty.^
Eny: We humbly request your help Sire. Flowey is under attack.^Eny: The people are holding the city but they can't hold it alone!^King: Hmm... I have heard the rumors, but how is one to believe?^King: If you could prove to me that there are monsters walking the earth once again, I would gladly send troops...^
King: Please, take your rest in the castle... stay as long as you like...^
Faelon: My Father, surely you don't believe these claims? Monsters walking the earth? It has been many years since!^King: Well... umm... I suppose you are right, son. I have left the troops under your control, so I trust your judgement.^Faelon: Thank you Father. Please, my Father must rest, be on your way...^
Eny: We have returned from Flowey with confirmation of the enemy invasion...^King: Save your breath child, we now know of the crisis to the north.^King: I deeply regret not sending troops to battle the monsters... but I hear you have quelled the immediate danger.^Eny: Yes, but we fear it will not stop until we uproot the evil that is in the staff my good friend holds.^King: Well, you may be in luck. A fisherman was here not an hour ago telling of a floating fortress in the waters up north.^Eny: But the seas are swarming with threats, we should be so lucky as him to escape them safely!...^
Eny: Well, for now we are short-handed...^Faelon: I would be honored to serve my King by helping you!^Eny: That's great!^Faelon: We should prepare supplies and weapons, and then leave immediately.^Faelon: The shop may have something new you can use.^Eny: Yes, let us go...^
King: Welcome back. My Son, it's good to see you and your friends again...^Faelon: Father, we have nearly achieved victory, but the staff must be destroyed!^King: Ahh... well, there is one way...^Eny: Tell us, we'll do anything!^King: Throw the staff into a volcano, it's the only way.^Mel: There is a live volcano East of here, through the jungle.^King: Aye, that is where you must go.^King: And you need to go soon... Our troops are battling monsters all over the continent.^King: You brave four must leave soon.^Eny: Thank you Sire, we will be on our way.^King: Do return! \ Faelon: Yes my Father!^
King: Congratulations!^
King: A staff on the moon is certainly better than a staff on the Earth...^However, no place is safe as long as the staff remains.^
King: Quick, to the volcano!^
King: Please, take your rest in the castle... stay as long as you like...^
Faelon: I'm glad you made it back! The turmoil is mostly over with here, thanks to you!^
You can't go in there...^
Shopkeeper: Welcome! We have just got some new stock!^
Faelon: Please, give me some privacy...^
Astronomer: Where will this planet take us next, hoohoo!^
Astronomer: Oh dear, the volcano is being active... but I see the moon is a little bit brighter too...^
Astronomer: Ohhh... you must be part of the disturbance in the stars!^Astronomer: Yes, the moons are lining up and new stars are appearing all the time...^Astronomer: I see a mountain, and a floating fortress... but that is not the end, oh no! Hehehe...^
Eny: I could sleep here...^
I'm from Flowey but I'm not much of a mystic...^
Congratulations on defending Flowey!^
That's a nice badge! It's a badge of the old Flowey guard... my grandfather was one of them!^Want to trade?^
Eny: We made it!...^
Eny: Look everyone!...^
Eny: We've done it! The staff is destroyed!^Let's get back home now.^
Eny: Look everyone! It's the Portal!^Tode: Noone shall pass.^Eny: In your dreams!^
Captain: We'll be here for you mate, if you need our services again.^
Gunnar: So, what do you think?^Rider: Is that thing seaworthy?!^Gunnar: Absolutely...^Eny: Well if it can get us to the floating fortress it will have done it's job.^Faelon: Gunnar, are you equipped for battle?^Gunnar: No, I will have to stay with the sub, or there's no getting off of that fortress...^Faelon: Hmm, then we need some one else...^
Mel: I hear you're looking for help...^Rider: What help could you be?^Mel: I happen to be very skilled with magic!^Eny: You're a young girl, shouldn't you be home with your parents?^Mel: I don't have parents... I have no family at all...^Eny: Oh my... What happened?^Mel: Monsters got them...^Eny: So you think you have a score to settle then?^Mel: Yes. \ Eny: Alright then, you can come.^Eny: Let's go straight away, we have no time to lose!^Gunnar: All aboard!^
Captain: You want to board the ship? Aye, we set sail as soon as you're ready!^
Captain: Alright then, off we go!^
Mate: G'day! ...^
Girl: There are monsters attacking people in the area near Flowey.^Girl: The King will not believe that monsters have risen again!^Girl: The people of Flowey cannot hold the city much longer!^
Girl: Sure Flowey is safer now... but how long will it last?^
Gunnar: Wow! What a feat of engineering!^
Gunnar: No, I've never built a space craft... but I know someone who has.^Gunnar: Odd thing is he's a simple farmer!^
Would you like to go through
the trench again, or take the
longer, safer route?

Farmer: Oh hey, did my ol' buddy Gunnar tell ya's about my rocket ship? Come on outside, and I'll show her to ya's!^

Farmer: Hey fellers! Nice to see ya's again!^Farmer: Hey, say hi to my cows while you're here!^
It's great to be home! The monsters only ate 1 of my babies... cows that is.^
Guard: Am I ever glad to see you! There are two Golems breaking through the walls at the north of the village!^Guard: Most of our troops are defending the beach front.^Eny: What can we do?^Guard: Defeat the Golems, without walls the village will fall! And better make it quick!^
Guard: Don't go! Take care of the Golems first!^
Guard: No time for that! The golems are breaking through our walls!^
Guard: Whoa! You guys are amazing!^
Guard: Some folks have returned to their home, but most are still afraid...^
Guard: Some of the people in the surrounding area have moved into the inn. It's dangerous out there!^
Guard: You're my hero!^
Guard: We'll get these walls fixed right away!^
Guard: The new walls should hold, as long as no more golems come by...^
Guard: We'll get these walls fixed right away!^
Guard: Whew, I'm beat from fixing these walls.^
Guard: Better hurry!^
Eny: We better not take that... the guards need it.^
Zzz...^
Shopkeeper: I handle the weapons and armor, my husband deals with potions.^

Thank you so much for finding my key!^
Hi, I'm Leonard...^

Eny: Tig!! Please slow down!^Tiggy: I want to get home and cook some of those mushrooms!^
Eny: Tiggy!! Come back!^
Eny: Wow... what is it?^Tiggy: Some kind of wizard's staff... do you think?^Eny: No, it couldn't be...^
Eny: Tig... what are you doing?...^Eny: Tiggy?...^
Tiggy: Hey... what's that over there?^Eny: Come on, we have to get home before dark!^Tiggy: Just one minute, I want to see what it is...^
Tiggy: Take her to Ohleo Keep, to the north of here.^Tiggy: ... and prepare for war!^
Goblins: Yes, Master!^
Rider: This is my horse. He's old so he can't carry us both.^Rider: Get going!^
You drown in the cold sea...^

I'm so glad you're alright!^Tig: Do I know you?^Eny: Tig, it's me, your friend Eny...^Tig: You don't look like a friend of mine.^Faelon: Enough of this talk, he is the root of our problems...^Rider: He must be defeated!^Eny: No! Don't hurt him!^Tig: Hurt me?! Ahahaha... you must be playing.^
Tig: You see... You are no match for me!^Eny: Please Tiggy, listen to me...^
Tig: You're wasting my time!^
Tiggy: So where do we go from here?^Eny: The abandoned Keep north of Seaside... \ They're building an army!^Mel: Let's go, we don't have time to waste!^Eny: Hey, where's the staff...^Eny: THE STAFF!!! \ And where is Rider?^Tiggy: I saw him leave with the staff, I thought you knew?^Eny: Oh no, we have to find him! I think he will be at the Keep.^Tiggy: Then let's go!^
Tiggy: Eny? Who are these people? Where are we?...^Eny: Tiggy! That staff, it possessed you! You weren't yourself...^Faelon: He darned near killed us all!^Eny: Faelon, it wasn't his fault! It's the staff...^Tiggy: I'm very sorry, I was not in control of myself.^

Your friend finished his work here...^
My father is helping your friend downstairs... He has so much knowledge, oh my!^
One day I will manage this library just as my father has for so many years...^
Rios: I've come from Seaside where the library has been destroyed. I'm here to rewrite our history.^Librarian: Oh what a tragic event! Please, stay and commence with your work.^Rios: I will come back, first I must help deal with the invaders on the beach.^Librarian: Be safe my friend, I will see you soon.^
Welcome back!^
I'm making copies of everything so there is one for here and one for Seaside...^
Rios: The Staff seeks a soul to bind to...^It knows it is in danger here.^Did you know that we once had communication with moon-folk?^
Rios: This may take a while, but it has to be done.^Rios: Be very careful in your quest!^
Take care and come back soon!^
Rios: The entire library... destroyed.^
Rios: Well I do have all the books memorized...^Rios: I just need a safe place to store the new collection.^Eny: We're soon heading to the Eastern Kingdom. The Kingdom MUST be safe...^Rios: I see... and could you do with the services of a Cleric?^Rider: I hope you know how to wield that staff in battle!^Rios: Sure, but healing is my specialty.^Eny: Then join us!^
Speed is important to start, but everyone gets a turn...^
There are 3 elements of magic...^Fire, Ice, and Electricity...^Fire burns things that are flammable. Ice freezes hot things. Electricity blasts water elementals... usually.^
Some of the nicest treasures are the easiest to overlook...^
If someone wants something you have, do not hesitate to trade with him...^
Talk to everyone and you will gain much knowledge...^
It's not how much you make, but how you spend it...^
It is important to know your enemy's weaknesses...^
Use formations to your advantage...^Oh, you don't know about formations?^If you are closer to the enemy, you do more damage...^...but if you are farther away, you take less of a hit.^
Take a rest and record your progress whenever you can...^
Train wisely and balance your skills... a lopsided warrior is easy to knock down...^
Eny: Well there it goes! We'll have to wait and see if it gets there or not...^Eny: Now, let's find that Portal on the Dark Side!^
Witch: I knew you would come by this way... Your friend told me so.^Eny: Tiggy?! Where is he?^Witch: Nevermind that, I'm his new best friend...^Witch: Now you have to go back down the mountain... The hard way!^
Shopkeeper: Everything is on sale for you my friend.^
Female: Good luck.^
Female: Nice looking scope...^Female: I'm really going to be on the losing end of this deal but...^Female: Here, I'll trade you for this Light Orb.^Female: The orb will light your path even in darkness.^
Female: How did you get here?^
Albert: Hello friends.^Eny: Hello. We have come in search of a staff that landed here a few days ago.^Albert: I have the Staff you speak of.^Eny: We must have it. It must be destroyed. It has evil powers.^Albert: Indeed. But the Staff's power is only present on your planet.^Eny: We need to destroy the staff. Do you know how we could do that?^Albert: You would have to fly it into the nearest Star, but we have no ships in this day and age.^Eny: We have a craft, but it is our only transport home...^Albert: Well, there is one other way...^Eny: What is it?^Albert: There is a Portal to your planet on the Dark Side... But it is very dangerous!^Eny: We no longer fear danger. We will brave the Dark Side after we send the staff towards the Sun.^Albert: Very well. You may have the Staff. It's in that chest by the window.^
Albert: You are truly heroes!^
Albert: We all wish you the best!^
King Albert is very wise.^
King Albert is a descendant of the maker of the staff.^
We all wish to be as kind and knowledgeable as King Albert!^
Thank you for visiting our King...^
I was so happy when the Staff returned!^
King Albert's ancestor traded the Staff for building materials long ago...^
Tiggy: Oh my... I... uh... I did this?^Eny: No, this staff did this, it only used you as a vessel!^Tiggy: We must destroy this staff... perhaps the wise King would know how?^Faelon: Indeed, let's head to the East.^
When the fires started everyone went south.^
Say, is that a letter?^That looks like my father's writing!^... it's written to me!^Say, if you're going east, you may need this badge...^Fair trade? O.K.^
Captain: You want to board the ship? Aye, we set sail as soon as you're ready!^
Captain: Alright then, off we go!^
Captain: We can't sail yet!^Mate: We don't have a Cleric aboard.^
Mate: Sharks, crabs... these things are much more than just trophies!^
Mate: G'day! ...^
Most of the buildings are repaired now but it will take a while to get back to the way it used to be.^
"Closed for renovations"...^
Rios: Glad to see you! We are working hard here to rebuild the library.^Rios: You are all heroes!^Eny: You played your part too, Rios!^
Captain: You want to board the ship? Aye, we set sail as soon as you're ready!^
Captain: Alright then, off we go!^
Captain: We don't sail without a holy man... rules of the sea!^

They created a statue of Eny to honor her!^Eny: Wow... it's such an honor!^
Shopkeeper: Luckily for me, when the fires started, I had a rain spell!^
"Home of the world famous spicy meatball!"^
Male: Hi, how are you?^
Tipper: Oh yeah, I saw that meteor or whatever it was... landed North of here.^Tipper: I bet the King's men tracked it down.^Tipper: ... Sure I'll show you the way. I'm always up for adventure!^
Female: Oh, Earthlings, how wonderful!^
Male: We don't get many of your type around here these days...^
Shopkeep: I just finished making some spicy meatballs...^Shopkeep: Warning, vegetarians may not be able to keep the meatballs down!^
Female: Ages ago a meteor landed where this village now stands...^Female: Something in its makeup has kept evil away to this day.^
Male: If one wants a wife, he must brave the dark side... Alas, I am too cowardly.^
Female: My husband is a very adventurous fellow... he loves it but it worries me.^
